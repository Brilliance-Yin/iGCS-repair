====

iDroneCtrl (formally iGCS) is a UAV ground control station for iPad and iPhone. 

It is intended for use with UAVs and autopilots supporting the [MAVLink](http://qgroundcontrol.org/mavlink/start) protocol, such as  [ArduPilot Mega](http://dev.ardupilot.com) and the Pixhawk in the 3DR IRIS and IRIS+. AR.Drone 2.0 (with Flight Recorder) has also been tested.

iDroneCtrl requires the "Made for iPhone/iPad" iDroneLink available for sale at www.fightingwalrus.com

You can download iDroneCtrl from the Apple App Store here:

2. cd iGCS
3. ./scripts/updatedepends.sh
4. Run in the latest version of Xcode

Updating the MAVLink library
============================

The MAVLink header only C lib used in iDroneCtrl is generated from a fork of the master branch of the [MAVLink](https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink) project hosted on github.

Fighting Walrus maintains a [fork](https://github.com/fightingwalrus/mavlink) of the MAVLink repository that tracks upstream. Please use the following steps in order to update the MAVLink lib used in iDroneCtrl.

1. Ensure the master branch of https://github.com/fightingwalrus/mavlink has all upstream changes from master merged in to master our master branch.
2. Clone https://github.com/fightingwalrus/mavlink
3. Navigate to the pymavlink/generator directory
4. Run the gen_all.sh script like this: `./gen_all.sh`
5. Navigate to pymavlink/generator/C/include_v1.0 (we support MAVLink 1.0 but not v.9)
6. Create a branch of the iGCS project 
7. Copy the follow folders and files into the iGCS folder named `mavlink_include`

Folders and files to copy:

- arupilotmega
- autoquad
- common
- matrixpilot
- pixhawk
- sensesoar
- checksum.h
- mavlink_conversations.h
- mavlink_helpers.h
- mavlink\_protobuf\_manager.hpp
- mavlink_types.h
- protocal.h

Commit and push your changes and open a pull request for review and further HIL testing. In the pull request please note the commit or tag from the MAVLink repository that was used to generate the new MAVLink header files.
